# Gamedevelopment
Freelance gamedevelopment work

For the game with codename Zodiac I was contracted to create some small assets like potion bottles, 
but also a modular framework of walls to quickly build shacks and houses in the editor.
The assets are made in 3ds-max and textures are made in autodesk sketchbook.
